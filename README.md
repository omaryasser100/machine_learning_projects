# Classical Machine Learning Experiments

A collection of small projects exploring classical machine learning algorithms on various datasets.  
This is a sandbox for applying, comparing, and learning core ML methods through hands-on practice.

## Projects Included

Each subfolder or notebook is a standalone experiment using one or more classical ML techniques:

- **Regression examples** — linear regression, regularized regression  
- **Classification examples** — logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, k-NN  
- **Model evaluation** — cross-validation, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC)  
- **Preprocessing and feature engineering** — scaling, encoding, missing value handling  
- **Comparative analysis** — comparing algorithm performance on the same dataset  

## How to Use / Run
